In this paper, we devised an automatic creation support system for a draft of medical charts from endoscopic images using a deep learning model.
Instead of manually labeling each image, which was done in previous research, we created multi-label teacher data using drafts of medical charts actually created by doctors.
Thereby we succeeded in automating the creation of all learning data. 
The multi-label data is composed of a value indicating whether the anomaly is detected in the endoscopic images and several labels corresponding to frequently diagnosed disease names.
Using this learning data, we trained various deep learning models and compared them.
And some models recorded high predictive performance.
We also implemented a function that supports doctors' judgment by generating predictions with multiple reliability levels when generating prediction labels.
