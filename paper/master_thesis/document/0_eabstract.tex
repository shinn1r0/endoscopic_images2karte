In this paper, we devised an automatic creation support system for a draft of medical charts from endoscopic images using a deep learning model.
In previous studies, learning and prediction were performed on an image basis, and prediction on a patient basis was impossible.
It was a system that could predict only one type of lesion.
In this study, multi-label teacher data consisting of a label indicating whether one or more lesions exist and a plurality of lesion labels was used.
This made it possible to predict multiple lesions on a patient basis.
In addition, in the existing study, label data was manually assigned to all images, whereas in this study, multi-label data was automatically generated from a simple chart actually created by a doctor.
Using this learning data, we trained and compared several models of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks. And some models recorded high inference performance.
We also implemented a function that supports doctors' judgment by generating predictions with multiple reliability levels when generating prediction labels.
