In this thesis, we devised an automatic creation support system for a draft of medical charts from endoscopic images using a deep learning model.
Inspection images of patients include many images without lesions even when a patient has lesions.
In the previous studies, learning and prediction were performed on an image basis, and prediction on a patient basis was difficult.
In this study, we created a system that can learn and predict multiple images in endoscopy on a patient basis.
This system is composed of datasets in which the information of a simple medical chart is summarized for each patient, and models that can learn images and datasets on a patient basis.
The system in the previous study could predict only one type of lesion.
In this study, label data consisting of a label indicating whether one or more lesions exist and a plurality of lesion labels is used.
These improvements make it possible to predict multiple lesions on a patient basis.
In addition, in the existing study, label data was manually assigned to all images, whereas in this study, multi-label data is automatically generated from a simple chart actually created by a doctor.
Using this learning data, we trained and compared several models of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks. 
Some models recorded high inference performance for the task of predicting 10 or more multi-label simultaneously.
The F1-Score is 98\% or more in determining whether a patient had a lesion, and the F1-Score is 50\% or more in predicting multiple lesion information.
We also generate predictions with multiple reliability levels when predicting labels.
In the prediction of multiple lesion information, the precision is 87\% or more for highly reliable predictions, and the recall is 81\% or more for lowly reliability predictions.
As a result, the proposed system can be used to support the judgment of doctors.
